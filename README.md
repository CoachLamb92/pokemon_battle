# pokemon_battle
**A battler test project**

This is practice for a larger pokemon project. Hopefully this (or something similar) will be integrated into Pokemon Terminal

# To-do list:
## Pressing:
- Test new move-related methods in Pokemon Class
- Refactor for ease-of-reading/delegate to functions
- Add print-checking: test_move_success_check_returns_correctly_for_zero_accuracy_move
- Add print-checking: test_execute_move_prints_correctly_for_status_move function
- Add print-checking: test_execute_move_prints_correctly_for_non_damaging_move
- Add mock function that tests for the calling of subsequent functions (test_move_success_check_returns_correctly_for_full_accuracy_move)
- Add mock function that tests for the calling of subsequent functions (test_execute_move_calls_function_correctly)
- Add mock function that tests for the calling of subsequent functions (test_deal_damage_returns_correctly)
- Finish test calculate_damage_returns_correctly function

## General:
- Add is_fainted attribute to Pokemon Class
- Create a battle environment that takes the user pokemon and opponent pokemon
- Look into mocking specific values of functions using patch

## Stretch:

## Completed:
- ~~Create Pokemon Class~~
- ~~Create tests for Pokemon methods and attributes~~
- ~~Add a type grid with some testing~~
- ~~Create Move Class~~
- ~~Add in temporary way to get move data~~
- ~~Add attack method to Pokemon Class~~
- ~~Add take_damage method to Pokemon Class~~
- ~~Apply type effectiveness to damage calculation~~
- ~~Add STAB to damage calculation~~
- ~~Add user/opponent base stats to damage calculation~~
- ~~Add randomess to damage calculation~~
